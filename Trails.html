  The trail is in excellent shape, and gets right down to business, starting off venturing through a close forest with very little understory, but lots of moss. As you climb, you move swiftly from one steep but well-designed switchback to another, and yet another, gaining a little under 3,000 feet in a little under 3 miles.
While this can be draining, rewards await you at the top. Huckleberry bushes line the trail, and tired hikers can stop and munch on the sweet treats their their heart's content. After three miles, the trail reaches a ridgeline with a set of switchbacks heading up a rocky face. If you look to the east, some stellar views of the mountains can be seen, and on a clear day Glacier Peak graces hikers with an up-close and personal view.
  Tolmie Peak Lookout
  <h4> Location: Carbon River/ Mowich</h4>
    <h4> Length: 7.5 round trip </h4>
    <h4> Elevation: 5900 feet </h4>
    <h4> Rating: 4.5/5 stars 117 reviews </h4>

Hike to an old fire lookout with in-your-face views of Mount Rainier and a sapphire blue lake below. Tolmie Peak and Eunice Lake pack a one-two punch when it comes to scenery, but stopping at the picturesque lake is a perfectly acceptable destination as well. From the parking area at Mowich campground, set off around the west side of big, calm Mowich Lake. Take note, this is a great spot to take a quick dip once you're back from your outing. Follow the trail through open lowland forest along the west side of the lake, gaining elevation gradually, and then on increasingly steep grade as you move away from the lake up to tiny Ipsut Pass nearly two miles from the trailhead. This pass is part of the Wonderland Trail â€“ look down the other side of it to get an idea of how steep sections of this iconic trail are.
